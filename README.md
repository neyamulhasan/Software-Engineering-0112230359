# Brain Jam: Code Clash Arena

Brain Jam is a competitive programming platform designed for university students who want to sharpen their coding skills through real-time battles. Think of it as a mix between Codeforces and a gaming arena - you can challenge friends to 1v1 coding duels, join open lobbies with multiple players, and climb through military-inspired ranks from Private Recruit all the way up to Legendary General. The platform features an automated judging system that instantly evaluates your code, a smart matchmaking system that pairs you with opponents of similar skill levels, and a comprehensive rating system that rewards you for solving problems and winning matches. Whether you're a beginner looking to practice algorithms or an expert seeking intense competition, Brain Jam provides a structured yet engaging environment to improve your programming abilities while having fun with fellow coders.
